# Biography

Hello! I'm a cosmology PhD student at Ohio University. I'm interested in large scale structure measurements from galaxy redshift surveys. Particularly, my work has focused on the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation analysis with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, focusing on improvements to the treatment of overlapping galaxy populations and density field reconstruction. I am also interested in synergies between DESI and other upcoming next-generation surveys (Roman, Rubin LSST, etc.). I also spend time on outreach through a [STEM penpal program](https://prescientist.org/) as well as serving on the department's cohesion committee. I live in Athens, Ohio with my partner and our cat Charlie.

# Photography

I'm a hobbyist photographer, focusing primarily on 35mm analog photography of local landscapes and architecture. I'm currently in the process of setting up a darkroom in my apartment to produce my own enlargements. I plan to use this space in the future as a small gallery of sorts for my photography, so stay tuned.
